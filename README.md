# KMap
JDBC mapping pipeline using Rx and Kotlin.
Provides access to a JDBC ResultSet as an observable Stream of Records based on a SQL query. Supports laziness and paging.

This is an early alpha release. After a long period of inactivity, we are currently working on several improvements towards a more functional version. So stay tuned.
