# KMap
JDBC mapping pipeline using Rx and Kotlin.
Provides access to a JDBC ResultSet as an observable Stream of Records based on a SQL query. Supports laziness and paging.

This is an early alpha release. We are currently working on an improved version that allows for funtion-based declarative mappings and easy usage with different database dialects.
